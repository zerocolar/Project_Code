Database Backends
-----------------

In the examples seen so far, traces are simply held in memory and discarded once
the Python session ends. PyMC provides the means to store these traces on disk,
load them back and add additional samples. Internally, this is implemented in
what we call *database backends*. Each one of these backends is built from
two classes: ``Database`` and ``Trace`` which all present a similar
interface to users.
PyMC counts seven such backends: ``ram``, ``no_trace``,
``pickle``, ``txt``, ``sqlite``, ``mysql`` and ``hdf5``.
In the following, we present the common interface to those backends and a
description of each individual backend.


Accessing Sampled Data
======================

The recommended way to access data from an MCMC run, irrespective of the
database backend, is to use the ``trace`` method::
  
  >>> from pymc.examples import DisasterModel
  >>> M = pm.MCMC(DisasterModel)
  >>> M.sample(10)
  >>> M.trace('e')[:]
  array([ 2.28320992,  2.28320992,  2.28320992,  2.28320992,  2.28320992,
          2.36982455,  2.36982455,  3.1669422 ,  3.1669422 ,  3.14499489])

``M.trace('e')`` returns a copy of the ``Trace`` instance belonging to
the tallyable object `e`::

  >>> M.trace('e')
  <pymc.database.ram.Trace object at 0x7fa4877a8b50>

Samples from the trace are obtained using the slice notation ``[]``, 
similarly to NumPy arrays. By default, ``trace`` returns the samples from
the last chain. To return samples from all the chains, set 
``chain=None``::

  >>> M.sample(5)
  >>> M.trace('e', chain=None)[:]
  array([ 2.28320992,  2.28320992,  2.28320992,  2.28320992,  2.28320992,
          2.36982455,  2.36982455,  3.1669422 ,  3.1669422 ,  3.14499489,
          3.14499489,  3.14499489,  3.14499489,  2.94672454,  3.10767686])



Saving Data to Disk
===================

By default, the database backend selected by the ``MCMC`` sampler is the ``ram``
backend, which simply holds the data in RAM. Now, we create a
sampler that, instead, writes data to a pickle file::

  >>> M = pm.MCMC(DisasterModel, db='pickle', dbname='Disaster.pickle')
  >>> M.db
  <pymc.database.pickle.Database object at 0x7fa486623d90>

  >>> M.sample(10)
  >>> M.db.close()

Note that in this particular case, no data is written to disk before the call
to ``db.close``. The ``close`` method will flush data to disk and 
prepare the database for a potential session exit. Closing a Python session
without calling ``close`` beforehand is likely to corrupt the database, 
making the data irretrievable. To simply flush data to disk without 
closing the database, use the ``commit`` method. 

Some backends not only have the ability to store the traces, but also 
the state of the step methods at the end of sampling. This is particularly 
useful when long warm-up periods are needed to tune the jump parameters. 
When the database is loaded in a new session, the step methods query 
the database to fetch the state they were in at the end of the last trace.

.. warning::

  Check that you ``close`` the database before closing the Python session. 


Loading Back a Database
=======================

To load a file created in a previous session, use the ``load`` function
from the appropriate backend::

  >>> db = pymc.database.pickle.load('Disaster.pickle')
  >>> len(db.trace('e')[:])
  10

The ``db`` object also has a ``trace`` method identical to that of ``Sampler``.
You can hence inspect the results of a model, even if you don't have the model
around.

To add a new trace to this file, we need to create an MCMC instance. This time,
instead of setting ``db='pickle'``, we will pass the existing ``Database``
instance and sample as usual. A new trace will be appended to the first::

  >>> M = MCMC(DisasterModel, db=db)
  >>> M.sample(5)
  >>> len(M.trace('e', chain=None)[:])
  15
  >>> M.db.close()



Backends Description
====================


ram
---

Used by default, this backend simply holds a copy in memory, with no output
written to disk. This is useful for short runs or testing. For long runs
generating large amount of data, using this backend may fill the available
memory, forcing the OS to store data in the cache, slowing down all other
applications.


no_trace
--------

This backend simply does not store the trace. This may be useful for testing
purposes.


txt
---

With the ``txt`` backend, the data is written to disk in ASCII files.
More precisely, the ``dbname`` argument is used to create a top directory
into which chain directories, called ``Chain_<#>``, are created each
time ``sample`` is called::

    dbname/
      Chain_0/
        <object0 name>.txt
        <object1 name>.txt
        ...
      Chain_1/
        <object0 name>.txt
        <object1 name>.txt
        ...
      ...

In each one of these chain directories, files named ``<variable name>.txt``
are created, storing the values of the variable as rows of text::

  # Variable: e
  # Sample shape: (5,)
  # Date: 2008-11-18 17:19:13.554188
  3.033672373807017486e+00
  3.033672373807017486e+00
  ...

While the ``txt`` backend makes it easy to load data using other 
applications and programming languages, it is not optimized for speed nor
memory efficiency. If you plan on generating and handling large datasets, 
read on for better options.  


pickle
------

The ``pickle`` database relies on the ``cPickle`` module to save the
traces. Use of this backend is appropriate for small scale,
short-lived projects. For longer term or larger projects, the ``pickle``
backend should be avoided since the files it creates might be unreadable
across different Python versions. The `pickled` file is a simple dump of a
dictionary containing the NumPy arrays storing the traces, as well as
the state of the ``Sampler``'s step methods.


sqlite
------

The ``sqlite`` backend is based on the python module `sqlite3`_ 
(a Python 2.5 built-in) . It opens an SQL database named ``dbname``,
and creates one table per tallyable objects. The rows of this table
store a key, the chain index and the values of the objects::

  key (INT), trace (INT),  v1 (FLOAT), v2 (FLOAT), v3 (FLOAT) ...

The key is autoincremented each time a new row is added to the table, 
that is, each time ``tally`` is called by the sampler. Note that the 
``savestate`` feature is not implemented, that is, the state of the step 
methods is not stored internally in the database.

mysql
-----

The ``mysql`` backend depends on the `MySQL`_ library and its python wrapper
`MySQLdb`_. Like the ``sqlite`` backend, it creates an SQL database containing
one table per tallyable object. The main difference with
``sqlite`` is that it can connect to a remote database, provided the url and
port of the host server is given, along with a valid user name and password.
These parameters are passed when the ``Sampler`` is instantiated:

* ``dbname`` (`string`) The name of the database file.

* ``dbuser`` (`string`) The database user name.

* ``dbpass`` (`string`) The user password for this database.

* ``dbhost`` (`string`) The location of the database host.

* ``dbport`` (`int`)    The port number to use to reach the database host.

* ``dbmode`` {``a``, ``w``} File mode.  Use ``a`` to append values, and ``w``
  to overwrite an existing database.

The ``savestate`` feature is not implemented in the ``mysql`` backend.

hdf5
----

The ``hdf5`` backend uses `pyTables`_ to save data in binary HDF5 format.
The ``hdf5`` database is fast and can store huge traces, far larger than the
available RAM. Data can be compressed and decompressed on the fly to
reduce the disk footprint.
Another feature of this backend is that it can store arbitrary objects.
Whereas most of the other backends are limited to numerical values, ``hdf5`` 
can tally any object that can be pickled, opening the door for powerful and
exotic applications (see ``pymc.gp``).

The internal structure of an HDF5 file storing both numerical values and
arbitrary objects is as follows::

  / (root)
    /chain0/ (Group) 'Chain #0'
      /chain0/PyMCSamples (Table(N,)) 'PyMC Samples'
      /chain0/group0 (Group) 'Group storing objects.'
        /chain0/group0/<object0 name> (VLArray(N,)) '<object0 name> samples.'
        /chain0/group0/<object1 name> (VLArray(N,)) '<object1 name> samples.'
        ...
    /chain1/ (Group) 'Chain #1'
      ...

All standard numerical values are stored in a ``Table``, while ``objects``
are stored in individual ``VLArrays``.

The ``hdf5`` Database takes the following parameters:

* ``dbname`` (`string`) Name of the hdf5 file.

* ``dbmode`` {``a``, ``w``, ``r``} File mode: ``a``: append, ``w``: overwrite,
  ``r``: read-only.

* ``dbcomplevel`` : (`int` (0-9)) Compression level, 0: no compression.

* ``dbcomplib`` (`string`) Compression library (``zlib``, ``bzip2``, ``lzo``)


According the the `pyTables`_ manual, `zlib` has a fast decompression,
relatively slow compression, and a good compression ratio;
`LZO` has a fast compression, but a low compression ratio;
and `bzip2` has an excellent compression ratio but requires more CPU. Note that
some of these compression algorithms require additional software to work (see
the `pyTables`_ manual).


Writing a New Backend
=====================

It is relatively easy to write a new backend for ``PyMC``. The first step is to
look at the ``database.base`` module, which defines barebone ``Database``
and ``Trace`` classes. This module contains documentation on the methods that
should be defined to get a working backend.

Testing your new backend should be fairly straightforward, since the 
``test_database`` module contains a generic test class that can easily 
be subclassed to check that the basic features required of all backends 
are implemented and working properly.
