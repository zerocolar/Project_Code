// This calculates the probability of a given feature vector, as defined by the kernel density estimate defined by the provided spatial and kernel (with an associated alpha). You also provide the normalising multiplier, as that can be cached to save repeated calculation, and quality to define the search range around the kernel. The norm parameter must be the kernel normalising constant divided by the weight of the samples and factoring in the scale change - as calc_norm does. Note that this is strange as it expects fv in scaled space and then outputs a probability in unscaled space!..

// This draws a sample from the distribution - you provide the usual indexing structure, which contains the data matrix, the kernel to use and an index into the philox rng, which it then uses to deterministically draw into out. out must be long enough to store the # of dimensions within the data matrix...

// Calculates the log probability of all the items in the data set, leave one out style - allows for model comparison so you can optimise any of the parameters, such as scale or kernel type. Parameters match up with the prob function, except it gets the feature vectors from spatial and returns a negative log probability. It includes one extra parameter - a minimum probability to assign to any given exemplar, to limit the damage of outliers...
// (Note that it does not correctly adjust the total weight for each exemplar probability calculation, which technically can bias things a bit if they all have different weights, but not really enough to worry about, and it would prevent the use of the norm optimisation.)

// Given a kernel (with an alpha parameter), spatial indexing data structure and a feature vector this updates that feature vector to be its mean shift converged point. A temporary vector of the same length as the feature must also be provided. The quality parameter goes from 0 to 1, and maps to the low and high spatial ranges provided by the kernel. There is also an epsilon parameter - it stops when movement drops below it, typically something like 1e-3 is good. The iteration cap ensures that no infinite loops cna occur if epsilon is too low. If the spatial has an ignore entry in the feature vector it uses that as a weight (Will call the get method of spatial.)...

// Given a Spatial, a Kernel (with its alpha parameter) and an (empty) Balls this assigns modes to every single point in the data matrix contained within the Spatial - after running the Balls object contains the modes, and the output array, aligned with the exemplar index of the data matrix, contains the indices of the modes for each data point (check_step is how many iterations to do between checking if its intersected a hyper-sphere that indicates convergance - exists because that check is much slower than doing a bunch of iterations.) Note that if spatial has an ingored vector then the same vector must be ignored by balls...

// This uses subspace constrained mean shift to project a given feature vector to a manifold. The degrees parameter indicates the degrees of freedom of the surface to converge to - 0 is standard mean shift (Don't do this - its much faster to do the normal thing), 1 will extract lines (1D surfaces), 2 will extract a 2D manifold and so on. Requires the spatial to define the density estimate, plus the feature vector, which is modified in place until it converges - output is in effect a point on the manifold. Also requires four temporaries - grad, for the gradient (Same size as fv); hess, for the hessian (Size of fv squared); eigen_vec, for the eigen vectors of the hessian (Size of fv squared); and eigen_val, for the eigen values (Size of fv). Additionally there are various parameters, for determining accuracy when evaluating the kernels and detecting convergance. The always_hessian parameter should be non-zero for the correct algorithm, but if 0 then it just calculates the hessain once at the start, which saves a lot of time and still works for clean data. Note that this is coded to only work with the unit isotropic Gaussian kernel, hence the kernel is not a parameter...
